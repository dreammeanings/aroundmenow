# Slider Accuracy Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
The distance slider was dragging wildly and inaccurately, making it difficult for users to select precise distances.

## ðŸ”§ Root Cause
The original gesture calculation was too complex and didn't properly account for:
- Current slider position
- Translation relative to slider bounds
- Proper percentage calculations
- State management during dragging

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. **Simplified Gesture Logic**
```typescript
const onSliderGestureEvent = (event: any) => {
  if (sliderWidth > 0) {
    const { translationX } = event.nativeEvent;
    
    // Calculate the percentage change based on translation
    const percentageChange = translationX / sliderWidth;
    
    // Calculate new distance based on current distance plus change
    const currentDistance = localFilters.distance;
    const distanceChange = percentageChange * 100;
    const newDistance = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, currentDistance + distanceChange));
    
    // Only update if the distance actually changed significantly
    if (Math.abs(newDistance - currentDistance) >= 1) {
      handleDistanceChange(Math.round(newDistance));
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. **Improved State Management**
- Added `isDragging` state to track gesture state
- Proper gesture state handling (BEGAN, END, CANCELLED)
- Added slider ref for better position tracking

### 3. **Better Accuracy Controls**
- **Percentage-based calculation**: Uses translation relative to slider width
- **Incremental updates**: Changes distance based on current value plus translation
- **Significant change threshold**: Only updates if change is >= 1 mile
- **Bounds checking**: Ensures distance stays within 0-100 range

## ðŸŽ¨ Key Improvements

### Before
- Complex position calculations
- Wild and inaccurate dragging
- Poor user control
- Inconsistent behavior

### After
- **Simple percentage calculation**: Translation / slider width
- **Incremental updates**: Builds on current distance value
- **Smooth control**: Responsive and accurate dragging
- **Consistent behavior**: Predictable slider movement
