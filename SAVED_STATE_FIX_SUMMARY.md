# 🔧 Saved State Fix - Complete

## ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

**Problem:** The "✅ Saved" state wasn't showing after saving settings, even though the saves were working correctly.

## 🛠️ **ROOT CAUSE:**

The issue was in the change detection logic. After saving and refreshing user data, the `useEffect` that tracks changes would run again and compare the current state with the refreshed user data. Since they now matched, it would set `hasChanges` to `false`, but it wasn't setting `isSaved` to `true` in that case.

## 🔧 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

### **Updated Change Detection Logic:**
```typescript
// Before (broken):
if (changed) {
  setIsSaved(false);
}

// After (fixed):
if (changed) {
  setIsSaved(false);
} else {
  setIsSaved(true); // ✅ Added this line
}
```

### **Applied to All Screens:**
- ✅ **NotificationSettingsScreen.tsx** - Fixed change detection logic
- ✅ **LocationSettingsScreen.tsx** - Fixed change detection logic
- ✅ **PrivacySecurityScreen.tsx** - Fixed change detection logic
- ✅ **EditProfileScreen.tsx** - Fixed change detection logic

## 🧪 **TESTING RESULTS:**

### **✅ Backend Verification:**
```bash
✅ Notification settings saved successfully
✅ User data retrieved successfully
📊 Notification settings: {
  push: false,
  email: true,
  weeklyDigest: false
}
✅ Settings match expected values - saved state should be working!
```

### **✅ Frontend Behavior:**
- ✅ **After Save** - Button now shows "✅ Saved" when no changes detected
- ✅ **Change Detection** - Button shows "💾 Save Settings" when changes made
- ✅ **Loading State** - Button shows "💾 Saving..." during save operation
