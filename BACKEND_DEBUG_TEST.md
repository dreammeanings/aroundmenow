# 🔧 Backend Debug Test

## 🚨 **ISSUE: Some Saves Work, Some Don't**

From the backend logs, I can see:
- ✅ **Some PUT /api/users/profile requests return 200** (success)
- ❌ **Some PUT /api/users/profile requests return 400** (error)

This suggests the backend expects specific data structure or validation.

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING STEPS:**

### **1. Test with Minimal Data:**
1. **Login as user** → Go to Profile tab → Click "Edit Profile"
2. **Enter only name:**
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: (leave as is)
   - Phone: (leave as is)
   - Bio: (leave as is)
3. **Click "Save"**
4. **Check console logs** for the exact data being sent

### **2. Test with Different Data Combinations:**
1. **Test with only name and email**
2. **Test with only name and phone**
3. **Test with only name and bio**
4. **Test with all fields**

### **3. Check Backend Error Details:**
The backend logs show "400 124" and "400 136" - this means the error response is 124 or 136 characters long. We need to see the actual error message.

## 🔧 **POTENTIAL FIXES:**

### **1. Try Different Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Current structure
{
  id: "user_id",
  name: "Test User",
  email: "test@example.com",
  phone: "123-456-7890",
  bio: "Test bio"
}

// Alternative structure 1
{
  user: {
    id: "user_id",
    name: "Test User",
    email: "test@example.com",
    phone: "123-456-7890",
    bio: "Test bio"
  }
}

// Alternative structure 2
{
  profile: {
    name: "Test User",
    email: "test@example.com",
    phone: "123-456-7890",
    bio: "Test bio"
  }
}
```

### **2. Try Different Endpoint:**
- Maybe it should be `/api/users/me` instead of `/api/users/profile`
- Maybe it should be `/api/profile` instead of `/api/users/profile`

### **3. Check Authentication:**
- Maybe the token is not being sent properly
- Maybe the token is expired
- Maybe the backend expects different headers

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Test with minimal data** to see if any save works
2. **Check console logs** for the exact error message
3. **Try different data structures** based on backend requirements
4. **Check if authentication is working** properly
