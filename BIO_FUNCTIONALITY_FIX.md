# 🎯 Bio Functionality Fix - Complete

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

The bio field was disappearing after saving because it wasn't properly implemented in the backend.

### **🔍 Root Cause:**
- ❌ **Missing Database Column** - No `bio` column in users table
- ❌ **Missing Backend Route** - Bio field not handled in profile update
- ❌ **Missing API Response** - Bio field not returned in user data

## 🛠️ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Added Database Column**
**File:** `backend/migrations/002_add_bio_to_users.js`
```javascript
exports.up = function(knex) {
  return knex.schema.alterTable('users', (table) => {
    table.text('bio');
  });
};
```

**Migration Status:** ✅ **Successfully Applied**
```bash
npm run migrate
# Batch 2 run: 1 migrations
```

### **2. Updated Profile Update Route**
**File:** `backend/src/routes/users.js`
```javascript
// Added bio field to request body
const { name, phone, avatar, bio } = req.body;

// Added bio field to update data
if (bio !== undefined) updateData.bio = bio; // Allow empty bio strings
```

### **3. Updated Profile GET Route**
**File:** `backend/src/routes/users.js`
```javascript
// Added bio field to response
res.json({
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name,
    bio: user.bio, // ✅ Added this line
    avatar: user.avatar_url,
    // ... other fields
  }
});
```

### **4. Updated Auth Routes**
**File:** `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
```javascript
// Added bio field to login response
user: {
  id: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  bio: user.bio, // ✅ Added this line
  // ... other fields
}

// Added bio field to /me endpoint response
user: {
  id: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  name: user.name,
  bio: user.bio, // ✅ Added this line
  // ... other fields
}
```
