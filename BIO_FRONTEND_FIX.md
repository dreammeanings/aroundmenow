# 🎯 Bio Frontend Fix - Complete

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

The bio field wasn't being saved from the frontend because it wasn't being included in the `updateData` object sent to the backend.

### **🔍 Root Cause:**
- ❌ **Missing Bio Field** - The `handleSave` function in `EditProfileScreen.tsx` was only including `name` and `phone` in the `updateData` object
- ❌ **Bio Not Sent** - The bio field was being collected from the form but not sent to the backend
- ❌ **Backend Working** - The backend was correctly handling bio updates, but the frontend wasn't sending the bio data

## 🛠️ **FIX IMPLEMENTED:**

### **Updated EditProfileScreen.tsx**
**File:** `src/screens/EditProfileScreen.tsx`
```typescript
// Before (missing bio):
const updateData: Partial<User> = {};
if (name.trim().length >= 2) {
  updateData.name = name.trim();
}
if (formattedPhone && formattedPhone.length >= 10) {
  updateData.phone = formattedPhone;
}

// After (with bio):
const updateData: Partial<User> = {};
if (name.trim().length >= 2) {
  updateData.name = name.trim();
}
if (formattedPhone && formattedPhone.length >= 10) {
  updateData.phone = formattedPhone;
}
// ✅ Added this line:
updateData.bio = bio.trim();
```

## 🧪 **TESTING RESULTS:**

### **✅ Backend Test (Working):**
